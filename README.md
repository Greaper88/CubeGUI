This is just a very basic GUI that is intended to install, manage, and remove an instance of Cuberite on your Windows-based system.
Simply download the release and run the file. It is a self-extracting archive made with 7zip.
If downloading an update, you may be prompted to overwrite existing files, simply click Yes or Yes To All.
Once completed, there will be a "Setup.exe" file that needs to be run to install the GUI.

This project is not affiliated with the Cuberite project, and may not be used without in whole or part without permission.
